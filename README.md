SOLDAGE is a Java framework for defining pipelines that generate RDF Graphs, including appropriate metadata, from CSVs. This is a core API (see `core/`) against which plugins can be created (see `plugins/`). Such plugins can be used in the pipelines defined by the user to generate RDF (see `pipeline/`).
