ALDAPA
======

## What?

ALDAPA stands for Assistant for Linked DAta Production Automation, a Java framework for defining pipelines that generate RDF Graphs, including appropriate metadata, from CSVs. ALDAPA is a core API (see `core/`) against which plugins can be created (see `plugins/`). Such plugins can be used in the pipelines defined by the user to generate RDF (see `pipeline/`).

(Trivia: in Basque language, "Aldapa" means "Hill". Sometimes, converting data to RDF does feel like climbing a very step hill!).
